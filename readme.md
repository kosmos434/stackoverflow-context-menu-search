## About
This is pretty simple. Highlighted text is saved into a variable and slapped onto the end of a URL. That's added to the context menu and away you go.

#### Todo
* ~Context menu that changes with the selected text~
* Account for no highlighted text
* Submit to [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
